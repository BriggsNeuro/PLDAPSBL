Fixing monitor issues:

First, log out and log in (resets screen configuration)

Then, open NVIDIA application (in toolbar on right) and check that the settings are correct:
	X Server Display Configuration Tab:
		- 2 screens visible; left: User screen; right: ViexPixx
		- click on the user screen: 
			Configuration: X screen 0
		- click on the ViewPixx screen: 
			Configuration X screen 1
			resolution: 1920 x 1080
			120 HZ
			no rotation, no reflection

	GPU1 Tab, submenu for the Viewpixx monitor, submenu controls:
		- Color Range: Full
		- Dithering: Disabled

Next steps:
- If the Viewpixx shows up as disabled, or is assigned anything other than X screen 1, contact 	Kristina
- If the resolution and frame rate are wrong, change and hit apply, then quit NVidia app
- If dithering has been enabled, disable and quit Nvidia app (is applied automatically)
